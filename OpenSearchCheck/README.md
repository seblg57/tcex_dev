# OpenSearchCheck - ThreatConnect Playbook App

## Overview

OpenSearchCheck is a custom Playbook App designed for ThreatConnect to perform comprehensive health checks and statistics collection on an OpenSearch cluster.

This app connects to your OpenSearch cluster and retrieves key information about cluster health, node status, shard distribution, and index-specific metrics.

---

## Features

- Checks cluster health status (`green`, `yellow`, `red`)
- Retrieves number of nodes in the cluster
- Reports active primary shards, active shards, unassigned shards, and percentage of active shards
- Fetches document statistics (`docs.count`, `docs.deleted`, `store.size`) for the `orgs` index
- Counts total shards across the cluster
- Supports Basic Authentication with optional username and password
